# What is the internet
- the prototype was know as the ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) 
- No one controls the internet, but access is gated behind an ISP
# Wires, cables and WiFi
- Everything is transferred using bits
- Bits are the atoms of the internet - good analogy
- Bit-rate - amount of bits we can transfer over a certain amount of time
- Ethernet - signal loss over long distances
- Fibre optic cable - uses light, good at long distances
# IP addresses and DNS
- The internet is a design philosophy using a set of protocols (TCP/IP)
- IP Address - Internet Protocol Address. 
- Traditional IP Addresses are 32 bits, 8 bits for each part
- First part is network
- Second part is the Subnet
- Third part is the device
- ^ this is IPV4
- IPV6 uses 128 bits per address
- DNS associates addresses and names so you don't have to remember Addresses
- DNS is open to the public - DNS spoofing is the coolest attack, very antiquated though
# Packets Routing and reliability
- Packets choose the "cheapest" route.
- The internet is fault tolerant
- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- TCP is scaleable 
# HTTP and HTML
- Uniform Resource Locator - URL
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - HTTP(S)
- Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML
- Cookies are how servers remember you
- Secure Sockets Layer - Transport Layer Security - SSL and TLS
- SSL and TLS require a Digital Certificate from a trusted authority
