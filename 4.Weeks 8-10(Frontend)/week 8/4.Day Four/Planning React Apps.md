# Wireframing
- Figma seems like a good tool for this
- We can use wireframing to create a wireframe to get a visual idea of how the app should look
- It's easier to build mobile first
- Start by creating the top level app

- styling and css doesn't really have any baring on the parent child structure of the React app.
- This means we can have manager and controller functions rather than route everything through the tree and passing stuff down.
