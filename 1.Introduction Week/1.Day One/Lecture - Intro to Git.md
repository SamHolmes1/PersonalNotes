# Hardware vs Software
- Hardware and software work together

## Hardware
- Anything that is programmable

## Software

# Terminal commands
- Echo: prints to console, useful for piping
- ls: list current directory
- cd: Change directory
- ls -a shows hidden files


# Intro to Git
## What is Git 
- Version control
- Timeline
- "save" = snapshot
- Tells a story
- git - Global information tracker

## GitHub
- Online platform for storing commits
- Git is the photograph, GitHub is the album


## Commit etiquette
- Make sure commits are descriptive enough.
- Don't just write "All this mornings work"
- Commit messages should be high level - "adds sendMessage functionality" is okay


## Example
```
git init

git status

git add README.md // Adds README.md to the staging area

git status

git commit -m // commits to the timeline and creats a snapshot. -m lets you add a message
```

- When you commit, the staging area is cleared, If you want to commit other things they have to be added again.
