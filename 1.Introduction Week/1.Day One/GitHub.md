# Remotes

- Git clone sets the remote as well.
```
Git clone {URL} // creates the directory and sets the remote

git add README.md // You still have to add

git commit - m "useful message" // You commit to the change on the local machine

git push origin main // Push to the repo(origin) and push to the main branch
```

```
git pull origin main // Checks for any changes to the branch and updates the local
```

# Pair Programming
- Driver and navigator
- Driver types - navigator decides the logic

- Pre-remote - two people working at the same machine
- Post-remote - video calls and screen share

- No set time for switching between navigator and driver but should be fairly frequently
